1. Overview
-----------

This file describes SETools, developed by Tresys Technology.  SETools
is a collection of graphical tools, command-line tools, and libraries
designed to facilitate SELinux policy analysis.  Please consult the
KNOWN-BUGS file prior to reporting bugs.


2. Installation
---------------

SETools uses the Python setuptools build system to build, and install.
As such it contains a setup.py script that will install the setools.

2.1. building SETools
---------------------

Unpack the official distribution or check out the git repository,
and perform the following:

  $ cd setools
  $ python setup.py build
  $ python setup.py install

This will put the applications in /usr/bin, data files in /usr/share/setools,
and libraries in /usr/lib/pythonX.Y/site-packages/libapol.


2.2. setup.py flags
-------------------

Please see `python setup.py --help` or `python setup.py install --help`
for up-to-date information on build and install options, respectively.


2.3 unit tests
--------------

One goal for SETools is to provide confidence in the validity of the
output for the tools.  The unit tests for SETools can be run with
the following command

  $ python setup.py test


3. Features
-----------

SETools encompasses a number of tools, both graphical and command
line, and libraries.  Many of the programs have help files accessible

  sedta:
      A tool to perform domain transition analyses on an SELinux policy.

  seinfo:
      A tool to quickly get a list of components from an SELinux policy.

  seinfoflow:
      A tool to perform information flow analyses on an SELinux policy.

  sesearch:

      within an SELinux policy.


3.3. analysis libraries
-----------------------

The SETools support libraries are available for use in third-party
applications.  Although they are not officially supported (and thus
subject to change between SETools releases), we will do our best to
maintain API stability.


4. Obtaining SETools
